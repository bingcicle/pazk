Algorithms in Proofs, Arguments and Zero-Knowledge

Simple algorithm implementations in [Proofs, Arguments and Zero-Knowledge](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.pdf) in Odin

### Why Odin?

- Odin supports [array programming](https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/#array-programming), which makes it convenient to multiply arrays.
- I wanted to learn Odin :)

### Run

```sh
odin run freivalds.odin -file
```

### Test

```sh
odin test .
```
